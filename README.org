** dired -- Create a dired buffer of files listed on stdin.


Often I find I would like to create a list of files using some unix
command and have a dired buffer containing those files.  This short
script does that.  It creates a temporary file .my-dired.el which is
not deleted by default for debugging purposes.

#+begin_src perl :noweb yes :tangle ~/langs/bin/perl/dired :tangle-mode (identity #o755)
#!/usr/bin/perl
# this file generated from <<filename()>>
use Cwd qw(getcwd);

$elfile = ".my-dired.el";
    
## (dired-other-window '("my dired" "~" "txt" "~/txt/add.tex" ".emacs" "foreign.pdf"))
open(OUT, '>', $elfile) or die $!;

$buffer = "my-dired";  
$dir = getcwd();


## Can use `dired' or `dired-other-window'.

print OUT "(dired '(\"$buffer\" \"$dir\"\n";

while(<>) {
    chomp;
    print OUT "\"$_\"\n";
}

print OUT "))\n";

close(OUT);

system("emacsclient -n -e '(load-file \"$elfile\")'");

##unlink($elfile);



#+end_src


Example: find all the PDFs and open in dired.

   fd -x pdf | dired

Example: show all files that are currently registered

   git ls-files --exclude-standard --other | dired

** Alternative C-x 3 and C-x 2

The default behaviour for C-x 2 (split-window-below) is to divide a
window into two, showing the same buffer in each window.  I would
prefer the two windows to show the most recent two buffers.  Alex Branham
had solved this problem before
https://gitlab.com/jabranham/emacs/blob/master/init.el#L2537

I simply added the extra configuration to switch-to-prev-buffer-skip
so that if you use C-x 2 or C-x 3 n times, then you see the n+1 recent
buffers.  Thank you Alex.
